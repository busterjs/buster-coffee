# buster-coffee

[![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/busterjs/buster-coffee.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/busterjs/buster-coffee)

An extension for [Buster.JS](http://busterjs.org) to automatically compile your
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) files before running tests.


## Installation

Install from npm:

    npm install buster-coffee

Then add it to your `buster.js` config file:

    config["My tests"] = {
      // ...
      extensions: [require("buster-coffee")]
      // ...
    };


## Configuration

The extension has no configuration options.


## Example web project

See the `demo/` dir for an example project using Buster.JS and buster-coffee to
test a function that is implemented in CoffeeScript, using tests written in
CoffeeScript.


## Example web project using AMD/RequireJS

If you are using buster-amd, you don't need buster-coffee to compile
your CoffeeScript files, but can instead use e.g. the require-cs AMD loader
plugin. See the `demo-amd/` dir for an extensive example project, using
Buster.JS to test AMD modules written in CoffeeScript and loaded with
RequireJS.


## Node.js and `require()`

Currently, buster-coffee does not work with files that are to be included using
`require()`. buster-coffee never writes any files to disk, while `require()`
explictly looks for the files it will include on disk. Because of this,
buster-coffee has limited use for Node.js development in CoffeeScript.


## Changelog

### 0.1.5 (2014-09-11)

- Update links after repo move.

### 0.1.4 (2013-01-06)

- Set the ETag on the generated JavaScript resource to the same as the original
  CoffeeScript resource. This ensures that any generated JavaScript cached by
  Buster.JS will be invalidated when the CoffeeScript source changes.

### 0.1.3 (2012-05-24)

- Leave `.coffee` files untouched if the `environment` setting is set to
  `node`. Contributed by Stephen Moore.

### 0.1.2 (2012-05-21)

- Remove unused dependency on `when`.

### 0.1.1 (2012-05-20)

- Use the coffee-script module's API instead of executing the `coffee` command.

### 0.1.0 (2012-05-20)

- Initial release.
